# ðŸŽ“ C - Binary Trees
Fourth important project at Holberton School, created to understand Binary Trees concept

## At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Description :scroll:

## Requirements :exclamation:

## Files :gear:
All of the following files contain functions written in C :
|**Filename**|**Description**|
|:-------|:---------:|
|`binary_tree_print.c`|Functions to print binary trees in a pretty way. [Original code](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13755911/5184480)|
|`binary_trees.h`|Header file which contains all functions prototypes and includes librairies|

## Compilation
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using :
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
```
