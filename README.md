# ðŸŽ“ C - Binary Trees
Fourth important project at Holberton School, created to understand Binary Trees concept

## At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
